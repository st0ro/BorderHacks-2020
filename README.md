# BorderHacks 2020
BorderHacks 2020 submission from Team Winnable  
This is a small game we created using Slick2D and LWJGL libraries.  
In light of recent events, we were inspired to create a simulation of the pandemic, and experimented with the idea of running a country.  
We tried to recreate the difficulty of implementing various policies with unexpected outcomes. For example, the economy and the reception of citizens were taken into account.
